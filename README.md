# Starborne Assistant

Mobile client for the game [Starborne](https://starborne.com), built in react-native + typescript.

This app only communicates with the official starborne servers, and user data is not sent anywhere else. 

# Discord
The best way to contact me with questions is through the discord server for the app: https://discord (dot) gg/tNDr7Db

# FAQ
- Q: Is my data safe?
  - A: Yes, the app only communicates with the official starborne servers, and your user/pass and other info are stored encrypted on your device. The app is open-source for a reason, you can verify yourself.
- Q: Where is the documentation for the starborne API?
  - A: There is none, I reverse-engineered the game client using [dnSpy](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy).
